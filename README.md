## Tomás Rodríguez Gamboa
I am an MSc Economics student at Universidad Alberto Hurtado (Chile) and a Research Assistant to **Dr. Carlos J. García** and **Dr. Bárbara Boggiano**. My research focuses on macroeconomic dynamics, growth theory, and numerical methods—particularly the generalized Schur (QZ) decomposition for solving linear rational expectations models—as well as microeconometrics, development economics, and applied causal inference.
